# Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project
## Problem Statement:

<p>Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise. We need to extract all the Amazon sales datasets, transform them using data cleaning and data preprocessing and then finally loading it for analysis. We need to visualize sales trend month-wise, year-wise and yearly-month wise. Moreover, we need to find key metrics and factors and show meaningful relationships between attributes.</p>

## Approach
<p>The main goal of the project is to find key metrics and factors and then show meaningful relationships between them based on different features available in the dataset.</p>
<pre> 
<li> Data Collection      : Imported data from various datasets available in the project using Pandas library. </li>
<li> Data Cleaning        : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.</li>
<li> Data Analysis        : I started analyzing dataset using Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib and Seaborn. </li>
<li> Data Visualization   : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables. Also used Tableau and PowerBI for data visulization. </li>
